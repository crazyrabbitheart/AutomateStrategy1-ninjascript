Inside Bar Strategy

Session Times
-I need to be able to select the session time for the strategy
- I need to be able to select a time period where no new trades will be placed so that I can avoid news spikes
For example: no trades allowed between 7:30 am to 7:35 am

Filter
Use SMMA as filter (it was hard for me to find this in Ninjatrader. I will send you the indicator that has the SMMA in case you donâ€™t already have it.)

Entry Criteria
Only go long on break of inside candle when inside candle closes above 21 SMMA.
I need to be able to select the offset for the trigger. The default offset should be 48 ticks

Stop Loss
I need to be able to select the Stop Loss amount in ticks. The default stop loss is 40 ticks

Take Profit
There should be 2 options for Take profit
First option should be a lookback function ( I should be able to select how many bars to lookback from the entry bar) Default is 10 bar lookback.
If there are no bars available for the lookback then the alternate TP should be full ATR value based on the inside candle.
